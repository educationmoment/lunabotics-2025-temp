1. Message Types

If we have custom .msg files (e.g., special drive commands, scoop commands, or status messages), we need to import them.

2. Hardware-Specific Motor Control

my code only does drivetrain_control_node or scoop_control_node shows a stub method like send_to_sparkmax(left_speed, right_speed).

we must implement real calls to your motor controllers,via CAN (yes we CAN!)


3. Camera Input & Processing


The vision_data_node uses a simple subscription to sensor_msgs/msg/Image.

In reality, we need to process the images (OpenCV-based object detection) and then publish results or pass them along to Nav2.


Since we have multiple cameras, we need to set the correct topics, handle synchronization, and so on.

4. Joystick Mapping


In the brain_node.py example, I assumed a button toggles “auto vs. manual” and that axes[0]/axes[1] were linear and angular.

We need to figure out your actual button mappings and axis indices and adapt the code accordingly.



5. Error Handling

The  code doesn’t handle exceptions like “camera not found,” or “motor controller unresponsive.”

We need to add that (heartbeat system)

6. Nav2 Config

We need more parameter YAMLs, ie costmaps planners etc

We should add:

Action clients for NavigateToPose.

A LifecycleNode with proper bringup and tear down.

TF transforms, map server, localization, etc.

7. Scoop Logic

This is a skeleton ScoopControlNode. We  need to define how you command the scoop (e.g., position vs. speed) and what sensors or limit switches are read.


8. status tracking

in status_tracking_node we must add things like drivetrain status, scoop status, battery status, etc.

9. webgui integration

use rosbridge_suite and roslibjs in the browser, & integrate rclpy directly in the Flask app.

10. firewall

pssshhh do we need security?
